2. Open the HTML file in a browser to view the webpage.
1= 🏠 Home

Goal: Capture attention + deliver the pitch in 60 seconds or less.
Tone: Clean, confident, math-first. No hype.
2= 📊 Details

Goal: Show the tech. Impress the brain. Eliminate uncertainty.
Tone: Technical, visual, and auditable.
3= 🧠 Philosophy

Goal: Speak to the mind. The ones who trust logic, not marketing.
Tone: Rigorous, minimalist, and transparent.
4=👾 Existing Crypto-Users

Goal: Speak directly to crypto-native users. Let them compare protocols and adopt with confidence.

🚀 TNT-Bank: The Last Crypto You’ll Ever Need

Built for logic. Auditable by math. Trusted by no one—and that’s the point.
💎 1. Unbreakable Security—Not Just “Strong”

Bitcoin burns energy. TNT‑Bank burns ambiguity.

    🔐 Dual-Key Signatures: You approve both outgoing and incoming transfers.

    🔄 2-Minute Finality: Atomic batch processing. No forks. No race conditions.

    🔭 Quantum-Resistant: Engineered to withstand future-state cryptanalysis.

    🧠 No Double-Spending—Ever: Proven impossible via Coq-verified formal proofs.

    “TNT isn't assumed secure—it’s provably secure under the same axioms that underpin Bitcoin’s own cryptography.”

🔍 2. Truth > Trust: Everything is Verifiable

No marketing claims. Just math you can inspect.

    🧾 All logic—from wallet structure to routing—is expressed in pure λ-calculus.

    🏛️ Full implementations in Scheme and Prolog are human-readable and auditable.

    🧪 Smart contracts are self-contained theorems—provable or rejectable.

    You don’t have to trust us. You can evaluate the math yourself.

🔑 3. Total Control. No Middlemen.
