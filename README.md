    <h1>🚀 TNT-Bank: The Last Crypto You’ll Ever Need</h1>
    <p>Built for logic. Auditable by math. Trusted by no one—and that’s the point.</p>

    <h2>💎 1. Unbreakable Security—Not Just “Strong”</h2>
    <p>Bitcoin burns energy. TNT‑Bank burns ambiguity.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>🔐 <strong>Dual-Key Signatures:</strong> You approve both outgoing and incoming transfers.</li>
        <li>🔄 <strong>2-Minute Finality:</strong> Atomic batch processing. No forks. No race conditions.</li>
        <li>🔭 <strong>Quantum-Resistant:</strong> Engineered to withstand future-state cryptanalysis.</li>
        <li>🧠 <strong>No Double-Spending—Ever:</strong> Proven impossible via Coq-verified formal proofs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>“TNT isn't assumed secure—it’s provably secure under the same axioms that underpin Bitcoin’s own cryptography.”</p>

    <h2>🔍 2. Truth > Trust: Everything is Verifiable</h2>
    <p>No marketing claims. Just math you can inspect.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>🧾 <strong>All logic</strong>—from wallet structure to routing—is expressed in pure λ-calculus.</li>
        <li>🏛️ <strong>Full implementations</strong> in Scheme and Prolog are human-readable and auditable.</li>
        <li>🧪 <strong>Smart contracts</strong> are self-contained theorems—provable or rejectable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You don’t have to trust us. You can evaluate the math yourself.</p>

    <h2>🔑 3. Total Control. No Middlemen.</h2>

    <h2>📊 Details</h2>
    <p>Goal: Show the tech. Impress the brain. Eliminate uncertainty.</p>
    <p>Tone: Technical, visual, and auditable.</p>

    <h2>🧠 Philosophy</h2>
    <p>Goal: Speak to the mind. The ones who trust logic, not marketing.</p>
    <p>Tone: Rigorous, minimalist, and transparent.</p>

    <h2>👾 Existing Crypto-Users</h2>
    <p>Goal: Speak directly to crypto-native users. Let them compare protocols and adopt with confidence.</p>
    <p>Tone: Tactical, precise, peer-to-peer.</p>

    <h2>💼 Become a TNT-Bank Client</h2>
    <p>Gives you the option to actually buy the tokens, get a wallet, and so on.</p>
